# CVE-2022-36752

png2webp v1.0.4 was discovered to contain an out-of-bounds write via the function w2p. This vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted webp file when reversing the format back to png.

## Reproduction

To reproduce the vulnerability, download the vulnerable version of png2webp (v1.0.4) and compile the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/landfillbaby/png2webp.git
cd png2webp
git checkout 0c7119109cde91127a263bf0af252e5e730f7fba
git submodule update --init --depth 1
./configure && make
```

Once the project has been compiled, we can point png2webp towards our malicious .webp file included in this repository (CVE-2022-36752_crash.webp):

```
./png2web -r CVE-2022-36752_crash.webp
```

The previous command will produce a crash and return an error message:

```
corrupted size vs. prev_size
```

To gain a better understanding of where the crash is taking place, lets recompile the project with address sanitizer (ASAN) by adding -fsanitize=address to the CFLAGS variable in the Makefile. We also want the compiler to store symbol table information in the executable (-g flag) to help us determine which line of code produced the crash:

```
ifeq (${uname_m},x86_64)
CFLAGS ?= -O3 -Wall -Wextra -pipe -flto=auto -DNDEBUG -march=x86-64-v2 -fsanitize=address -g
```

Next we will clean any stale files and recompile the project:

```
make clean
make
```

ASAN reports an invalid write of size 12 in the program, confirming the existance of an out-of-bounds write vulnerability:
